		<p><br>
		This page describes the progress as I build this website and the thoughts behind each step<br>
		This is all very much a work in progress (arnt we all...)<br><p>
		step 1. create some html pages with boilerplate html and add some content. i...is this content?<br>
		step 2. this needs a bit of style. add a css file and link the html to it. i found some boilerplate css online that i like the look of and ill adapt it to fit the style i want<br>
		step 3. i need a way to go backwards when I invaribly mess something up. create a git repo and commit the files.
